function tga(){
$('#introTwo').html("<h3>A pokemon's performance in battle is influenced by...</h3>Mainly it's Combat Power (CP), level, skills and Individual Value (correlated to each other) (IV).<h3>Combat Power</h3>Every pokemon has 3 value to measure it's power: attack, defence and stamina. CP is the simplest way to measure a pokemon by its individual value, and it's easily understood with an algorithm: <br>CP = MAX(10, FLOOR(Stamina^0.5 * Attack * Def^0.5 / 10))<br>Someone may be curious about how Niantic design the IV for each pokemon, and it is proved that these 3 values are combined from the 6 individual values of the pokemon in generaion 6 by another algorithm. You can see the <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4t7r4d/exact_pokemon_cp_formula/'>Reddit link</a> for more details. Actually, though a high CP does mean that the pokemon is stronger, it cannot provide players with a complete comprehension to the pokemon, and we also needs the following factors: <h3>Level (Correlated to CP)</h3>You cannot see your pokemons' levels in the game, but we can guess or measure them base on several things: <br>1.a rule that pokemon's level must <= trainer's level + 1.5<br>2.Each time you power up, the level of pokemon will increase by 0.5.<br>Then we can guess the level of pokemon base on this sheet (the number of candies needed might be slightly different from actual):<br><img src = 'stardust.png' name = 'pic' alt = 'star' style='width:600px;height:500px;'><br>A high level of a pokemon means that its CP will also be comparatively high, and the stardust and candies you need to power it up each time will also keep increasing. After level 30, the benefit of power up will be reduced to half of before (like from 40CP/power up to 20CP/power up), and the cost will be quite high, which can be regarded as one of the penalty of a too high level.<h3>Skills (Important and unrelated to other attributes)</h3>Each pokemon has two kinds of skills: quick move and main move. And for most pokemons these two moves are randomly chosen between several possibilities. The difference of skills may influence the damage of pokemon by 10%-20% or even more; thus, skills are quite important for players who want to train a pokemon to be a core. CP can be increased by leveling up (power up), but skills cannot be changed by anyway when they are confirmed at the time you catch or evolve the pokemon. About if a quick move/main move is a good skill for a pokemon, you can view this website for the possible and best moveset combination for pokemons: <a href = 'https://pokemon.gameinfo.io/'>link of the website</a><br>This website also has many other practical functions, which would be talked about later. For now, when you open the page of each pokemon in this website, you can see the quick moves and main moves it own, and their<br>DPS: The total damage (after considering critical strike chance and 25% same type attack bonus)/the time this skill needs<br>However, in a gym battle even DPS cannot precisely determine a pokemon's damage, especally considering that you may need to dodge the enemy's skill. Thus never be too serious about these numbers, they mean something but not everything.<h3>Fluctuated Individual Value</h3>This is not known by most players, even after the update of appraisal system (you can click the appraisal button in the right bottom of a pokemon's panel)<br>Besides the fixed attack, defence and stamina values, each pokemon has three 0-15 fluctuated values for these three attributes. Example: Let's say a Lapras has attack be 200, defence be 210 and stamina be 220 when it is level 40. If it's final IV is just 200, 210, 220, we say it's IV is 0%; if it's final IV is 215, 225, 235, we say it's a 100% IV Lapras. In short, the fluctuated IV, or IV%, is just the sum of 3 fluctuated values divided by 45 (15*3).<br>Undoubtedly IV% unchangeably matters the power of a pokemon, which cause many players to mindlessly chase for a extremely high IV% one. But after research, we find that a 90% IV pokemon is just around 2% less powerful than a 100% IV one, and 80% IV is 4% less powerful, and 50% IV is 9% less powerful. Therefore IV% is so not as important as skills, or we can say you don't need to worry it at all as if the pokemon doesn't have a quite low IV%. Another explicit example: A 100% IV Gyarados with Twister main move is worse than a 0% IV Gyarados with Hydro Pump main move. What's more, <a href = 'https://pokemon.gameinfo.io/'>the website mentioned before</a> also provides a function to measure(atually list all the possibilities) the IV% of a pokemon, and this function is much improved after it combined the official appraisal system and could usually located the possible IV% to 2 or 1 possibilities. The function is in the 'IV calculator' page in the website.<br>About appraisal system, I think it's quite a practical function, since it's highest rank is over 80% IV, and for most pokemons it is already unnecessary to check the specific IV% in websites if the IV% is known to be over 80%. You can check the following graph for how to use the appraisal system: <br><img src = 'appraisal.png' name = 'pic' alt = 'appraisal' style='width:800px;height:400px;'><h3>Type Weaknesses and Resistant</h3>Will be mentioned in the skills in battle");

And trainers' level can affect your pokemons a lot, as well.<br>First, since hatched pokemons has all it's three fluctuated IV be random values in 10-15 rather than 0-15, it's much more possible to get a nearly perfect pokemon by hatching eggs. The level of hatched pokemon can be from 1 to 20, but cannot exceed the trainer's level, which means a trainer with low level will need more stardust and candies to power up it's hatched pokemon (if he get one with good IV%).<br>High level also has advantages while catching pokemons. Since the highest level of pokemons appear outside is 30, and it cannot exceed the trainer's level, getting a good pokemon with high level surely save you lots of stardust and candies.<br>You can also unlock some new items after reaching certain level, like ultra ball, max potion, or even max revive in lv30.<h3>Train your core pokemon</h3>As said, the most important things for a core pokemon is that it should a have a great or best moveset, a not too low level (so that you don't need to pour huge amount of stardust), and also good IV%. The initial potential of the pokemon surely must be considered, since a ratata has exactly no value to train no matter its IV% or moveset. And, training low level pokemon is not rediculous, but just needs to consider more: Like if you may meet some similar pokemon with similar IV%, moveset and higher level, and if the pokemon itself has extraodinary potential. For example, I would like to train a lv1 100% IV Snorlax with perfect moveset, but would not like to train a lv10 perfect Gyarados, though Gyarados is also quite powerful: I have other powerful water type pokemons, and I could easily find Magikarps (maybe with high IV% and level), thus I would absolutely give up a Gyarados usless I have tooooo much stardust.<br>For the new players, my suggestion is: DO NOT use stardust to power up any pokemon, and try to find a perfect one to be your core after lv20 (since it's easy to find a good one from hatching), and FIRST evolve it to its last phase to make sure it also has a good moveset, and then consider about pouring your stardutst to the pokemon.");

Since I do not suggest trying one's best to defend, it's better for players to just put some low CP defenders. If you want to take n gyms, you may put your high CP ones in the first n-1 gyms to let them hold the gym longer.<br>There're many skills for attackers: First the quick move just need you to click the screen frequently and fast, and when you attack and get attacked you energy bar in top left will get filled. Based on different main move the energy bar may be one or more, and you can use your main move by pressing on the screen and holding when at least one energy bar is full. Usually, high damage main move has only 1 energy bar with 100 space, while medium damage ones may have 2 bars with 50 space each, some with three 33 space bars. etc.<br>Mention: Using your main move (by holding) during your quick move (especially slow ones) may fail because of haven't finish the quick move before using the main move. This will waste some of your time to do damage, so be careful to use your main move during the interval of your quick move.<br><h3>Type Weaknesses and Resistant</h3>In Pokemon Go, skills with type strong with enemy pokemon will get 25% bonus damage, while ones weak with enemy will get 20% less damage. You can check the detail in the websited mentioned before: <a href = 'https://pokemon.gameinfo.io/'>link of the website</a><br>How to check type: click on the Move page, while putting your mouse on any type you can find which types of pokemon is this type of skills strong with or weak with. Click on the Pokemon page, while putting your mouse on any type you can find which types of skills is this pokemon resistant to or weak to.<br><h3>Dodge</h3>This is the most essential skill in battle, since a successful dodge will let you take only 25% of original damage, which is quite useful against high damage main moves. Of course, since dodge also takes you some time, it does not mean it's 4 times easy than not dodging. Different moves has different intervals for dodge, which in game is like a flash with special animations. After you master this skill, dodge would become a usual thing in your gym battles, and you can gradually find how many times your pokemon could attack before dodging enemy's next attack. Vaporeon is one of the best pokemon to train dodge because it's water gun could attack per only 0.5s, so you will find it quite easy to stop your action and dodge enemy's attack. Vaporeon could even attack 4 times vs a Dragonite with steel wing, which is one reason that Vaporeon is so overpower now.<br>Mention: Blizzard is the only skill that has no dodge window, which means it can not be dodged. Therefore Lapras, Cloyster and Dewgong with Blizzard are sometimes much stronger than you think.<br><h3>Small trick</h3>Defender's quick move will be 1-2 seconds slower than usual, which means you may attack twice and dodge even against a really fast quick move like water gun. But defenders will consecutively attack twice at the beginning of battle, with no intervals between this double attack, and it may be a good choice to first stay calm and dodge this double attack especially if you are attacking a defender with high damage.");

For pokemons without evolving, especially ones that are powerful (like Lapras, Snorlax etc.), both IV% and moveset are already fixed at the time you catch them, and you must want to find a better one if the one you get is not worth training (Surely 10km eggs are much more reliable). For pokemons that could evolve, IV% may be the most important, since you could only know the moveset after you evolve them.<br>Mention: Any pokemon appear outside in a specific location has absolutely same IV% and moveset for all players there to catch it.

$('#introTwo').html("<h3>Use your pokecoins correctly</h3>This game is quite friendly to urban players, and there's not much need to buy coins. And, you can easily get like 20 coins per day by taking gyms. But no matter if you pay for coins or just get coins from gyms, it is necessary to use them in the right way.<br>First, based on pesonal opinions some players may want to enlarge their backpack capacity or pokemon capacity. That's fine, and my suggestion is pokemon capacity is usually enough since you can transfer your useless pokemons, but you will feel comfortable if you have a larger backpack.<br>Some players may want to buy some lucky eggs, and that's feasible choice, and necessary choice for ones who want good pokemons rather than just pokedexes. However, just around 20 or at most 30 lucky eggs are quite enough.<br>Lure modules and incenses are not recommended, especially for players with not many coins, since that's similar to just wasting the coins. In 'How to use incenses' we know that incenses do have some interesting mechanisms but it's really hard to make it effective.<br>Therefore, after buying small amount of lucky eggs, backpack capacities, or pokemon capacities, the best thing to buy is still Incubators. Collecting pokedexes, finding pokemons with high IV, or getting more candies, or whatever, Incubators are just the best items.");
